<hr><h3 align=center> What are the financial relationships between healthcare providers and manufacturers? </h3><hr>

### Overview: 
The _Physician Payment Sunshine Act of 2010_ is a law which was passed to provide transparency of financial relationships between healthcare providers and manufacturers, with the goal of uncovering potential conflicts of interest.  The law only affects manufacturers of medical devices, drugs, and other medical supplies, which are covered by the Federal programs of Medicaid, Medicare, and CHIP (Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program).  Compliance with the regulation requires disclosure of financial relationships to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which maintains this information in a publicly accessible database, found at the [CMS Website](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/dataset/General-Payment-Data-Detailed-Dataset-2017-Reporti/a3u6-h38p "The CMS Open Payments Database") . 

### Project Details:
This application provides a user friendly interface for anyone (including healthcare practitioners) who would like to access this data.
- How many payments were made to the specific doctor?
- What was the nature of the payments?
